<center><p><strong>About Me</strong></p></center>
<center><p>I am a freshman at The University of Texas at Austin majoring in Business Administration. I was born and raised
  in Harlingen, TX (nearby South Padre Island if you've heard of it) with my parents, older siblings (Alex & Mercedes) and our dog Sunny.
  I enjoy all kinds of sports, the beach, music, and having a good time with good people.(<br /><br /></p></center>
